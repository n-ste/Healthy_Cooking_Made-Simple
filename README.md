## User Experience
* In this project I've created a recipe website, this purpose is for users to be able to make healthy meals cooked from the comfort of their home without having to decipher difficult recipes. 
* I've created four pages, on the home page the user will find a summary of what the website is for with a few tips and an optional newsletter they can sign up to so they can remain up to date on the latest recipes.

## Design
## Typography
I carefully chose two fonts for this project as I didn't want to use too many and make the project look cluttered, I imported these to my CSS file from Google Fonts.
* For the title, headings and expand/hide buttons for the recipe instructions and newsletter I used the font Kanit, in weight 700.

* For the main body paragraphs and navigation links I used Montserrat, in its standard weight of 400.
